# Discussion and Acknowledgements

#### Discussion

The work presented in this report is the result of collaboration between
Kenai Watershed Forum (KWF) and the inter-agency team tasked with
managing invasive pike in the Vogel Lake / Miller Creek system. The
collaboration yielded readily applicable data, and may serve as an
example of a productive hands-on relationship between agencies and
nonprofits.

To develop this project, the Soldotna Office of the Alaska Department of
Fish and Game worked with KWF in 2019 to submit a grant submission to
the National Fish and Wildlife Association, which was funded in Fall
2020. Initial work in Fall 2020 consisted of establishing the flow
discharge site near the mouth of Miller Creek. Beginning in January, KWF
visited Vogel Lake in approximately every other month throughout 2021,
with frequency of site visits tapering throughout 2022.

These data may be revisited and analyzed in more detail if future work
in the area requires baseline water quality data. For example, an
ongoing discussion among agency staff has the potential to result in the
installation of a selective fish passage barrier to mitigate the
potential for future upstream pike movement.
