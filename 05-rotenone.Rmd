Rotenone application was performed in early October 2021 by ADF&G staff. The treated bodies of water included Vogel Lake, North Vogel Lake, and Miller Creek. ADF&G collected pre and post-treatment water samples as part of the treatment event, and Kenai Watershed Forum monitored degradation through Summer 2022 when levels fell to undetectable.

Field sampling and analytical methods generally followed those described in [Couture et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653521029507?casa_token=ay4PaETNCSQAAAAA:_IZ-AVNjAqJ4cdwnVLYAoXmbG5KvzPbpQ8aTeu54QqIzDietLnk1Xe_uj5z93IzrNsoCRwsSOaM). Prior to rotenone treatment, we collected a composite grab sample from two locations at a depth of 0.5 m near the center of each lake. Following treatment, we collected lake water samples at a depth of 0.5 m from two locations around the center of the lake either as a grab sample or with a Kemmerer sampler. For each strata of each lake, a single composite sample was created from the two locations. For benthic samples, the Kemmerer sampler was lowered to a depth within 2 m from the bottom in the same two locations around the center of the lake. The collected water from two locations was then combined into a single 1 L composite sample. All samples were collected into sterilized 1 L amber glass bottles, immediately chilled on ice, stored out of the light and transported to the Applied Science, Engineering and Technology (ASET) Lab located at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) within 72 h of collection. Upon arrival to the lab all samples were stored in the dark at 4°C and analyzed via high performance [liquid chromatography](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/liquid-chromatography "Learn more about liquid chromatography from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) within seven days of collection.

## Sampling schedule

The rotenone sampling schedule is described in table \@ref(tab:sample-schedule) or may be accessed in a Google Sheet linked here: <https://tinyurl.com/8ba94nrn>. The schedule is current as of `r Sys.Date()`.

### Sample results

#### Tables

Laboratory analysis of water samples is performed by the [ASET Laboratory](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/academics/college-of-arts-and-sciences/departments/chemistry/aset_lab/) at the University of Alaska Anchorage Department of Chemistry in Anchorage, Alaska. Detailed analytical methods can be found in [Couture et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653521029507?casa_token=ay4PaETNCSQAAAAA:_IZ-AVNjAqJ4cdwnVLYAoXmbG5KvzPbpQ8aTeu54QqIzDietLnk1Xe_uj5z93IzrNsoCRwsSOaM).

Original results received from UAA are available for download at the following link:

-   [Link: Rotenone Degradation Laboratory Results](https://github.com/Kenai-Watershed-Forum/Miller_Creek_Vogel_Lake_WQX/tree/main/input/rotenone_data).

A table of final results that have been integrated into a single dataframe and reshaped to a "long" format are available for download at the the following link:

-   [Link: Rotenone Degradation Final Results](https://github.com/Kenai-Watershed-Forum/Miller_Creek_Vogel_Lake_WQX/tree/main/output/rotenone_results)

A summarised version of the above downloadable table is displayed in Table \@ref(tab:rotenone-table). Values shown in Table \@ref(tab:rotenone-table) are averages of duplicate lab values (overall mean percent difference = `r avg_pct_diff` ± `r sd_pct_diff` %, mean ± SD).

**Note on Miller Creek results:**

-   Rotenone values for Miller Creek are not shown in a continuous time series figure due to more limited sample results from varying locations. See Table \@ref(tab:rotenone-table) for results from Miller Creek.
