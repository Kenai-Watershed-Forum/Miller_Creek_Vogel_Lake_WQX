# Rotenone monitoring

Rotenone application was performed in early October 2021 by ADF&G. ADF&G collected pre and post-treatment water samples as part of this event, and Kenai Watershed Forum will monitor degradation through until Summer 2022. Methods and results will be described here.

A proposed rotenone sampling schedule is described in a Google Sheet linked here: <https://tinyurl.com/8ba94nrn>

Laboratory analysis of water samples is performed by the ASET Laboratory at the University of Alaska Anchorage Department of Chemistry in Anchorage, Alaska. Results to date are available for download at the following link:
