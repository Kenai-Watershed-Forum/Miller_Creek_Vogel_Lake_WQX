# Rotenone monitoring

If rotenone application is included in the final plan after the Environmental Assessment process, Kenai Watershed Forum will monitor rotenone concentrations in the lake/creek system through Fall 2021 - Summer 2022.  Methods and results will be described here.

A proposed rotenone sampling schedule is described in a Google Sheet linked here: <https://tinyurl.com/8ba94nrn>

Actual sampling schedule will be dictated by observed decomposition rates.
