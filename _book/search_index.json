These data are being collected as part of potential plans to eradicate invasive pike from the area, which were identified in 2018-2019 by the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game. The draft environmental assessment for potential eradication of invasive Northern Pike from this system is available from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Water quality and watershed characterization fieldwork for this project is conducted by Kenai Watershed Forum. An ArcGIS Online map of sites included in water quality monitoring efforts is found here: https://arcg.is/0fqvb0. A GitHub repository with the code generating this report is also available.

Near the mouth of Miller Creek, a discharge measurement station was installed in October 2020. At this site a pressure transducer measures water level, and discharge measurements are collected periodically using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. These data, along with staff plate observations, are being used to create a rating discharge curve. An experiment to study stream flow rate in Miller Creek was conducted September 15-17, 2021. A plug of dissolved salt (NaCl) was discharged in to the creek, and the resultant spike in conductivity was observed downstream 0.64 km stream distance. Raw water quality field data is stored in a Google Sheet that can be viewed at https://tinyurl.com/kwf-vogel-wqx-data under the Discharge Measurements tab. Site photos are available through a point-and-click pop-up map at https://arcg.is/0fqvb0. 3.0.2 Miller Creek Discharge Rating Curve A discharge station was established in October 2020 near the mouth of Miller Creek, including a staff plate and pressure transducer. Site visits have been made opportunistically depending on precipitation throughout Summer/Fall 2021. At each site visit, the pressure transducer is downloaded and a discharge measurement is collected using a SondeTek Flowtracker. See Figure 3.1 for the discharge rates and staff plate values observed to date. Once a minimum of eight discharge measurements are available in Fall 2021, a curve will be fit to the scatter plot of stage height vs.Â discharge. This relationship will be used in conjunction with pressure transducer data to create a flow hydrograph. Figure 3.1: Measurements for Miller Creek Discharge Rating Curve 3.0.3 Discharge measurements at other sites Additional discharge measurements were taken throughout Summer 2021 at two additional sites near Vogel Lake, near the outlets of Kuguyuk Pond and Bird Pond. See Figure 3.2 for discharge values observed to date. Figure 3.2: Other discharge measurements 3.0.4 Pressure Transducer Data Work in progress here 8/10/2021 3.0.5 Stream Flow Rate Experiment On September 15-17, 2021 we conducted an experiment to examine stream flow rate in Miller Creek. We measured downstream transport time of dissolved solutes by deploying a plug of dissolved salt and measuring a resultant change in conductivity at a site downstream. 3.0.5.0.1 Methods We deployed a plug of dissolved salt into the Miller Creek stream channel and measured conductivity continuously at a downstream site. See Figure 3.3 for salt deployment and conductivity monitoring sites. Figure 3.3: Stream Flow Rate Study Area. Stream distance between the NaCl release site and the downstream measurement site is 0.63 km (0.39 mi). The Vogel Lake / Miller Creek system is a low-gradient drainage with little observable flow within 0.5 miles downstream of the lake outlet. We deployed our salt plug downstream from the Vogel Lake outlet at the first site with visibly evident surface flow, which was over the top of the first downstream beaver dam. We released 140 lbs of dissolved NaCl by dissolving appx 15 lbs at a time in a 35 gallon trash can, then discharging it on the downstream side of the beaver dam into the stream channel. Our downstream site monitoring conductivity was 0.63 km (0.39 mi) downstream center-channel. To record conductivity we used a pair of simultaneously deployed Hydrolab MS5 Sondes suspended from a floating buoy. We programmed the sondes to record at 0.25 hour intervals. We examined the resultant time series for exposure or errors and removed these data points. We averaged conductivity values between the two Hydrolab units in the final results. 3.0.5.0.2 Results We measured a readily evident rise in conductivity values at the downstream monitoring site. See Figure 3.4 for the time series of conductivity data. Figure 3.4: Conductivity values at the site downstream of the NaCl release site. The NaCl plug was released at 19:30 on 9/15/2021. The release and measurement site coordinates can be accessed at the ArcGIS Online Map at https://arcg.is/0LqOKH0. In Figure 3.4 we can observe the following: Initial NaCl Deployment: 9/15/2021 19:30 Start of the rising limb of the conductivity spike: 9/15/2021 22:00 (2.5 hrs after deployment) Maximum conductivity peak (~20% above baseline values): 01:30 9/16/2021 (6.0 hours after deployment) Return to baseline conductivity levels: 9/16/2021 15:00 (19.5 hrs after deployment) Based on these results, peak concentration of the dissolved solute traveled though this section of Miller Creek at 0.11 km/h (0.06 mph).

We used minnow traps to capture juvenile fish, which were later transported by helicopter to Bird Pond for winter residency until post-treatment rotenone levels decrease to safe levels. A fish barrier currently at the outlet of Bird Pond will be removed in Summer 2022 pending confirmation of safe conditions. 5.2 Methods We captured juvenile fish in the segment of Miller Creek extending from its mouth at Cook Inlet to a location upstream approximately 1.3 km from the mouth, N 60.99530, W -150.50760. We used Gee minnow traps baited with cured, disinfected salmon eggs. We placed eggs placed inside perforated canisters to prevent consumption by the fish. We placed minnow traps in locations known to be preferred by juvenile salmonids, including areas with woody debris, pools, and areas with riparian cover. We deployed traps for time periods of 6-12 hours at a time, and returned with all captured fish in five-gallon buckets to a central location. We identified all captured fish to genus or species for the purpose of ensuring that no juvenile pike were included in the captured population. After identifying fish taxa, we stored juvenile fish in three perforated five gallon buckets submerged within the creek on site. We placed stones at the bottom of each bucket to keep them submerged. These fish were stored until being retrieved by helicopter for transport to Bird Lake on 10/1/2021. 5.3 Results Table 5.1: Minnow trap deployment and fish capture, estimated data from Lower Miller Creek Deployment_Date_Time Retrieval_Date_Time Trap_Count Fish_Capture 2021-09-27 18:15:00 2021-09-28 10:00:00 48 400 2021-09-28 12:00:00 2021-09-28 18:00:00 48 150 2021-09-28 18:30:00 2021-09-29 09:00:00 30 75 Table 5.1 summarizes capture and effort data for fish rescue efforts in Lower Miller Creek. Due to limited available staff as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, minimal formal data on fish capture was recorded in order to focus primarily on maximizing the quantity of fish captured prior to rotenone treatment. As a result, values in table 5.1 are estimates rather than exact quantities. Fish captured from Lower Miller Creek were identified to species by ADF&amp;G staff prior to placement into Bird Pond, although these fish were not segregated from fish also captured in the Vogel Lakes complex and Upper Miller Creek. Table 5.2 provides total capture counts for fish rescue efforts throughout the Miller Creek/Vogel Lakes complex.
