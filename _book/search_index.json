These data are being collected as part of potential plans to eradicate invasive pike from the area, which were identified in 2018-2019 by the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game. The draft environmental assessment for potential eradication of invasive Northern Pike from this system is available from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Water quality and watershed characterization fieldwork for this project is conducted by Kenai Watershed Forum. An ArcGIS Online map of sites included in water quality monitoring efforts is found here: https://arcg.is/0fqvb0. A GitHub repository with the code generating this report is also available.

Hydrolab MS5 sondes were descended from an anchored boat centered over the deepest point of each lake.

These methods and results will be presented here. Raw water quality field data is stored in a Google Sheet that can be viewed at https://tinyurl.com/kwf-vogel-wqx-data under the Discharge Measurements tab. Site photos are available through a point-and-click pop-up map at https://arcg.is/0fqvb0. 3.0.2 Miller Creek Discharge Rating Curve A discharge station was established in October 2020 near the mouth of Miller Creek, including a staff plate and pressure transducer. Site visits will be made opportunistically depending on precipitation throughout Summer/Fall 2021. At each site visit, the pressure transducer is downloaded and a discharge measurement is collected using a SondeTek Flowtracker. Once a minimum of eight discharge measurements are available in Fall 2021, a curve will be fit to the scatter plot of stage height vs.Â discharge. This relationship will be used in conjunction with pressure transducer data to create a graph of flow. fig 3.0.3 Pressure Transducer Data Work in progress here 8/10/2021 "],["watershed-mapping.html", "4 Watershed Mapping", " 4 Watershed Mapping Watershed mapping efforts for this project include a combination of on the ground fieldwork and GIS based approaches.

A proposed rotenone sampling schedule is described in a Google Sheet linked here: https://tinyurl.com/8ba94nrn Actual sampling schedule will be dictated by observed decomposition rates.
