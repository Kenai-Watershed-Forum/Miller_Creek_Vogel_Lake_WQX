These methods and results will be presented here. Raw water quality field data is stored in a Google Sheet that can be viewed at https://tinyurl.com/kwf-vogel-wqx-data under the Discharge Measurements tab. Site photos are available through a point-and-click pop-up map at https://arcg.is/0fqvb0. 3.0.2 Miller Creek Discharge Rating Curve A discharge station was established in October 2020 near the mouth of Miller Creek, including a staff plate and pressure transducer. Site visits will be made opportunistically depending on precipitation throughout Summer/Fall 2021. At each site visit, the pressure transducer is downloaded and a discharge measurement is collected using a SondeTek Flowtracker. Once a minimum of eight discharge measurements are available in Fall 2021, a curve will be fit to the scatter plot of stage height vs.Â discharge. This relationship will be used in conjunction with pressure transducer data to create a graph of flow. p &lt;- discharge_dat %&gt;% ggplot(aes(Staff_Plate_Height, Q_Discharge_cfs)) + geom_point() fig &lt;- ggplotly(p) fig 3.0.3 Pressure Transducer Data Plot pressure transducer data (work in progress here 8/6/2021) pt %&gt;% ggplot(aes(datetime,val)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(param ~ .) # to do : use anti_join methodology to excise non-instream data # convert to plotly line chart?
