ADF&amp;G collected pre and post-treatment water samples as part of this event, and Kenai Watershed Forum will monitor degradation through until Summer 2022. Methods and results will be described here. 6.1 Sampling schedule A proposed rotenone sampling schedule is described in table 6.1 or may be accessed in a Google Sheet linked here: https://tinyurl.com/8ba94nrn. Schedule is current as of 2021-12-16.
